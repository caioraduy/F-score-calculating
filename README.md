# F-score-calculating
This the code for calculating the F-score of Tools for process drift detection.
The structure of the program is divided by:
1. F_score_Calcultor (main): funcions needed and the main code for calculating the F-score
2. DATA: this file files was data for testing the program
    -data/data_5k-> Event logs with 5000 and 9 sudden drifts from ""
    -data/data_5k_teste-> sample from data_5k
    -data/data_1000-> Event logs with 0 noise, trace ordering, 1000 traces, 1 drift
    and 1 drift from ""
    -data/data_teste_sudden-> Sample from data_1000
    -data/output_apromore-> 4 examples of tested experiments at Apromore ProDrift plugin with logs of data_1000
